        "selftext": "Okay, so everyone remembers me when I gave you the 500 bagger play on $DJT in March and everyone made a ton of money. I also gave the $DJT play in Jan and in Sep 2024. Well we're back one final time. \n\nI want to keep this DD super simple. $DJT is Trump's tech company he owns like 60% of called Trump Media & Technology Group. Everyone knows their earnings are shit but the company has NEVER traded based on earnings. The stock has been trading for 4 years now (first as DWAC now as DJT). If you look at the chart over the past 4 years the stock basically trades flat but has these insane 100% - 300% pumps for a week and then falls again. Let's look at what caused these insane run ups in the past.\n\n* Nov 2022: Trump announces he was running for President - **Stock went up 100% in a week**\n* Jan 2024: Trump wins Iowa Primary - **Stock went up 300% in a week**\n* Jun 2024: First Presidential debate with Trump / Biden - **Stock went up 60% in a week**\n* Sep/Oct 2024: Presidential Election run-up - **Stock went up 400% in a couple weeks** \n\nThe final play in my opinion is the Inauguration happening **Jan 20th** (next week). It's going to be the biggest event in the world that day, everyone's going to be there and Trump will officially be President of the United States. I believe $DJT is going to have an insane run-up starting on Monday (we were green Friday even though the market was blood red). My positions are below: \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/mlu0pd9u0fce1.png?width=2398&format=png&auto=webp&s=7c4527ea0b5890466b23df7c0580ed5b2fedecde\n\n**Positions:** Shares and OTM calls. I believe the Inauguration run-up will start Monday. I could be wrong, but if I am wrong, this will be the first time there's a major event with Trump that $DJT did NOT run up. So I am 95% sure I'll be right. ",

E-Trade says at random \"large orders are subject to manual review\" so this takes 1 - 2 minutes before the contracts can sell and if you're swing trading it can be devastating to the price. It usually happens randomly with 500+ contracts. Is there any brokers out there that does NOT randomly put orders in limbo for a minute even if it's like 10,000 contracts at once? ",

        "selftext": "I've been using E-Trade for 5 years now and love the platform better than all the other brokers. However recently I've come into an issue when selling large options orders. If I have a large amount of contracts (500 - 1,000+) and try to close them sometimes they don't execute. Even if my limit price is higher than the bid. It gets frozen for about 1 minute - 2 minutes. I called E-Trade and they said sometimes certain orders that pose a \"large risk\" have to go through a manual review before they can be executed. However if you're a trader, 1 - 2 minutes is way too long to wait. I've been able to bypass this if I break up the orders. For example instead of closing 1,000 contracts at once I can break it down into 300, 300 and 400 and don't run into this issue. However that takes time and as a trader it can be too much time. \n\nAre there any big traders here that have this same problem? Have you found any solutions? If I increase my account size and start trading 5,000 contracts at once I can't possibly break them into 20 orders of 250. I don't know why SELLING options you own for CASH is considered a \"risk\" as it's not margin or anything. Stopping the order from executing poses much more risk to an account. Do other brokers do this too? ",

I posted this before but my opinion was it never should have been banned on WSB. I get it's annoying as fuck watching morons think they're part of some \"movement\" spamming the ticker nonstop but this was the biggest and easiest trade of the week and WSB should be about playing the top trending news stories of the week and then moving onto the next trade when it's over. \n\nI do get the mods side though. So many morons who buy it think they're part of a bigger cause and ruin the fun for everyone else. The funny thing is back in 2021 Roaring Kitty was a nobody and people like Andrew Left who were shorting it were in fact the \"big guys\" and the story made sense. Now Roaring Kitty's net worth is like 100x Andrew Left's. Any moron who think they're still fighting for the little guy is a complete idiot. Also a future bagholder because the trade is over.

If you ever lost money with options daytrading and think you're gambling you just didn't know what you're doing. This is a 2 year chart of my daytrading account:\n\n[https://i.imgur.com/eqqblul.png](https://i.imgur.com/eqqblul.png)\n\nSure it's possible to make educated bets every now and then. I do that sometimes too for the risk/reward potential and I have loses because of that. However there are trades that are 90%+ certain if you know what you're doing based on intraday moves and headlines. \n\nNote on Technical Analysis daytraders who draw lines on charts and look for patterns. That's the biggest bullshit ever. That is 100% gambling, I have never done that. \n\nLong story short - you can make a real profession daytrading. You just have to do it and find certain things that will always work and you will be set for life. However in the process of learning you could lose all your money so trade with a paper account or very low amounts for at least a year....probably more. \n\n&#x200B;",

        "selftext": "$DWAC has been trying to merge with Trump's company Truth Social for the past 2 years. The problem is the SEC has been investigating them making it impossible for them to merge. The SEC finally resolved the lawsuit so the stock jumped from $12 to $17 where it is now on that headline  \n\n\nSo what's the problem? They haven't filed their S4 yet and don't plan to in October. However the SPAC will **EXPIRE** and **LIQUIDATE** on September 8th meaning as of right now on September 8th the SPAC will automatically go to $10.40. The ONLY way it can be saved by the MAGA people is if they vote to extend the SPAC for a year.\n\nThe problem with the vote is they need over 65% shareholder approval to pass the vote to save the SPAC. There was supposed to be a meeting today to tally the vote total, but the vote failed and they extended the meeting to September 5th. **IF THE VOTE DOESN'T PASS BY THE NEXT MEETING IT'S OVER FOR THEM.**\n\nIt's super hard to get 65% shareholder approval, especially when 90% of the people who own the stock are retail investors who don't even know they own it. Last year it took them over 4 months to pass this vote but this year they hardly have any time.\n\nPositions: Right now $15 puts expiring September 15th are trading for $1.00 meaning they will be worth $5.00 when the SPAC liquidates. It is also an easy short now until the next meeting on September 5th\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/tf598qsxcoib1.png?width=2182&format=png&auto=webp&s=2677424d1facfb7c12b0cb9c307ec53080e3cd92\n\n&#x200B;",

The only option  they had was to fork over $2.8 million to extend it 3 months or \\~$6  million to extend to 6 months.
