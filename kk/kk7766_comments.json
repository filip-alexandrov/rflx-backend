I have a 5 year history of DDs on WSB which is why I'm well known. I gave everyone the CLBR play under $14, informed everyone on what company they were merging with and always said my prediction was it will hit $20 pre-merger. That could still happen tomorrow, if it doesn't, we hit $18.47 so I was pretty close and everyone who bought at $14 is in the green. Now the reason everyone is mad is because I said it's most likely a \"buy the rumor, sell the news\" event. This is common in trading so I don't know why everyone is freaking out? Everything I previously said is still true. Yes it could hit $100+ after the merger, yes the most news coverage of the stock will likely be on merger day, yes it could be the next $GME / $DJT like meme stock. All of that is still possible...I really don't know how any of this is so hard to understand? If you are holding through the merger you are gambling hoping there is a giant squeeze and I hope it happens for everyone who does. I'm assuming the people freaking out have never even read my 5 years worth of DD because I never held anything through the event. I never held $DWAC through the merger, I never held $MSTR through the crypto summit, I never held $SNAP through earnings, I never held $DJT through the election. For everyone who did hold they understood they were taking a risk and nobody has ever got mad at me so I don't know why this time is different? Unless like I said everyone commenting is brand new to trading. And finally I have never deleted any of my comments or posts, that was the mods of WSB because the stock was under the 500m market cap rule.",

        "body": "I literally went to the Hamptons for two days, came back, and my inbox is absolutely flooded. A few things: \n\n1) If you're following me don't expect me to post every day. I've been posting about the CLBR to PEW merger happening next Wednesday and I've been keeping everyone up to date with any new public updates / important information. The amount of people freaking out because I didn't post for two days is insane. You have to take the information I give and make your own decisions. It really isn't that hard. \n\n2) More importantly, for everyone that came out to attack me yesterday. First of all I have 25,000 active followers on reddit and a lot of them have notifications turned on for when I post. Just because a comment of mine gets 200 likes (less than 1% of my followers) doesn't mean they're \"bots.\" If you look at the accounts of the people commenting they're all well established people on WSB that have been here for years. So the people telling everyone I pay for bots either didn't take 5 seconds to look at the accounts or are absolute morons. \n\nAlso there will be a time when I'm wrong about something. When someone has a big following and they're wrong (like Cramer) everyone will rush to laugh and make fun of that person. I'm okay with that! Please feel free to do it! But you have to understand the play first. The vote is not until Tuesday and we're basically at ATH during AH right now so just because we were down 3% yesterday everyone freaked out? Grow up. I said this is an easy $20 by Tuesday so let's see what happens. \n\n**3) The most important thing is the major update today -** The NSCC (National Securities Clearing Corporation) announced they will no longer handle the clearing and settlement of CLBR options exercises and assignments. That means Brokers now have to handle it by themselves now and since so many options were bought (good job guys) many brokers have DISABLED the buying of options. I don't remember the last time this has happened. That means they're extremely afraid. Why? If the stock goes parabolic they can't just offload the risk to the NSCC like they usually do. They're now personally on the hook to deliver real shares. And if there\u2019s a share shortage (very likely in a low-float SPAC like this), they might not be able to buy those shares at any reasonable price \u2014 or at all. \n\nThere's still ZERO media coverage of this so if it picks up this weekend and CNBC starts covering it we could see a real parabolic move like we haven't seen since 2021 Roaring Kitty era. Of course this only happens if the media covers it so let's see!",

The idea of \"squeezing billionaires\" was something everyone could get behind. It was never a short squeeze though, it was just retail piling in and becoming bagholders.

The first year I traded I made $10,000 which I consider breaking even (which was amazing based on how many fucking stupid and dumbass moves I made). The biggest thing in trading is being able to learn from your mistakes and know exactly what you did wrong so you never do it again. Most people are too cocky and complain the market is \"rigged against them\" when they lose.\n\nI've been doing this for so long now and on WSB for 6 years I see the biggest mistake newbies make. It's very easy to get lucky on trades, FOMO into something and make some good money, etc. But this is luck. 99% of the time new traders will win a few trades and get cocky and think they're actually good at trading. So they get more confident and then when reality hits they lose, and lose again, and again until it's all gone. You're only a good trader if you make money when the market goes up, goes down, and is flat. If you have consistent returns in all these scenarios over a 2 year + period then you can become cocky.",

Michael Saylors cost basis is so high, and he's on so much margin, if BTC were to fall 70% like it does every time there's a correction, he will be toast. There's a good chance Trump talked up crypto a bunch just to get elected and doesn't give a shit about it. I'm not saying go all in on shorting it, but if you don't think the government will get involved with crypto at all, being short is a good play. But the correction will prob take a while cause there's still so much hype. So nothing I'm saying is a short term play FYI",

        "body": "I'll give you an award, but I was still right a year ago in saying \"as long as there's no more pump and dump events.\" Trump becoming President was the ultimate pump and dump event because he's \"pro crypto.\" You can go through my post history in the last few months and you can see I was posting that BTC would go up if Trump won. Here's a screenshot of me making 250k with $COIN calls just from Trump winning. That's $250k net profit in just a couple days.\n\n[https://i.imgur.com/8nOnBg5.png](https://i.imgur.com/8nOnBg5.png)\n\nSo it may be satisfying to \"rub it in my face\" but I'm not a bull or bear, I'm a trader. I make money off trading on short-term catalysts and my account is up more than any stock or crypto this year. I also still stick to what I said, Trump winning just pushes it back a little. You would have to agree if Kamala won it never would have hit 100k. Not only that, the crash would have started. Trump has to get in office, they have to pass new laws that make crypto regulatory friendly, then when everyone realizes making crypto regulatory friendly doesn't actually do anything for the price it will start to go down. But now it's pushed back a couple of years",

In reality they're actually a shit ass trader who got lucky with 1 trade. Then they proceed to think they're better then everyone else, makes a bunch of the most regarded trades I've ever seen, portfolio then loses their entire portfoilo in a week. Seriously, if you look at every position he made after he got lucky with $MSTR they're so beyond stupid it's almost not comprehensible. So anyone reading this, it's possible to get lucky with a trade or lucky with a bull run if you have calls or market crash if you have puts. In order to be a good trader you need constant returns year after year in all types of environments and then you can gloat (like me). /end rant",

They just launched Truth+ Media which is a streaming service like Netflix or Hulu that they plan to have their own network of news, etc. Say Trump wins and they get people like Tucker Carlson, Joe Rogan, etc on. It could be something. Do I think Devin Nunes is smart enough to pull it off? Probably not, but I don't think the stock will immediately go to zero if he wins. It will probably be flat for a while....at least his first year.\n\nI do think there will be a greater runup until the election and the stock can double from here.

Selling my $130 NVDA calls for $150 calls exp next week. I\u2019m going full regard.\"\n\nThere's no way to justify $NVDA going that high next week. Maybe if there was some catalyst like earnings or a big event or something you could make the case, but just hoping it randomly goes higher based on nothing is how traders lose all their money. And my theory was simply if $NVDA went up in anticipation for the shareholder meeting, and the shareholder meeting was shit, buying puts may work out, but I'm not taking a position because it's not a strong enough play.",

I kept 120 calls left and sold some mostly in the morning, some throughout the day. I have 25 calls left I'm gonna hold till the end. If you bought at the low and sold at the current peak, you would have made 2,000% on Wednesday and 3,500% today. Overall my DD was correct. Feel free to follow me for future DD but I hardly post them because I only wait for something I can be confident of and those rarely come by. \n\nMany of you will be asking will the price go higher? Obviously I don't know. The volume today is 50 Million. I was hoping for 100 Million+ today and 300 Million+ tomorrow. What needs to happen is mass media coverage tonight and everyone in America talking about it for it go $120+ (IMO). \n\nThis was a lot of fun overall and hope everyone learned something.",

Here are some steps you might consider if you want to capitalize on Valentine's Day and sell unique gifts:\n\n1. **Market Research:**  \n\n\n* Research current trends and popular items for Valentine's Day. Understand your target audience and what they might be looking for.\n* Analyze your competitors and identify unique selling points for your products.\n\n1. **Product Selection:**  \n\n\n* Choose unique and appealing products that align with the Valentine's Day theme. Your idea of flower plushies with cute characters sounds like a good fit.\n* Ensure the quality of the products from your AliExpress suppliers.\n\n1. **Store Setup:**  \n\n\n* Create a user-friendly and visually appealing online store. Consider using platforms like Shopify, WooCommerce, or others to set up your store easily.\n* Optimize your product pages with high-quality images, compelling product descriptions, and clear pricing.\n\n1. **Marketing Strategy:**  \n\n\n* Develop a marketing plan specifically tailored for Valentine's Day. Utilize social media platforms, email marketing, and influencer collaborations to reach potential customers.\n* Highlight the uniqueness and sentimental value of your products in your marketing messages.\n\n1. **Pricing:**  \n\n\n* Determine a fair and competitive pricing strategy. While it's common to charge more than the AliExpress price, ensure your prices are reasonable and reflect the value you're providing.\n\n1. **Shipping and Fulfillment:**  \n\n\n* Communicate clearly about shipping times and any potential delays. Transparency is key to managing customer expectations.\n* Consider offering express shipping options for last-minute shoppers.\n\n1. **Customer Service:**  \n\n\n* Provide excellent customer service to build trust and credibility. Respond promptly to inquiries and address any issues that may arise.\n\n1. **Legal and Ethical Considerations:**  \n\n\n* Ensure that your business complies with all relevant laws and regulations, including consumer protection laws.\n* Be transparent about the origin of your products and the shipping times.\n\nRemember that ethical business practices and customer satisfaction are crucial for long-term success. Building a brand that customers trust and return to for special occasions will likely be more sustainable than a short-term profit-focused approach.",

That should have ended the meme craze but idiots kept holding on.\n\nBy the end of 2022 it was almost certain BBBY would be bankrupt as that's what the company basically said. That's why the stock started the year at $1.

Obviously algos and retail traders jumped into the stock and you can see it shot up. Usually these types of headlines only last a little while before dumping back down to where it was. $UBER did not move on this headline because it doesn't affect $UBER in anyway whatsoever.\n\nNow let's fast-forward to 12:20 PM. $LYFT gives the gains back and dumps cause this is normal with a headline trade like that. However $UBER dumps with $LYFT because the algos start trading it together even though this has NOTHING to do with UBER. You can see $UBER price at 12:25 PM makes no sense whatsoever because the news doesn't affect them. Obviously I saw this glitch and bought 0dte calls. \n\nFast-forward to 12:45 PM $LYFT dumps even more giving back all the gains and $UBER drops even further. Look at $UBER price at 12:45 PM. It makes no sense whatsoever and it was all because the algos traded $LYFT with $UBER. I was down 10k at this point, 75% on my 0dte and doubled down. \n\nOf course the algos corrected themselves and it was a +20k for me. Should have been a +100k trade but the market is regarded and always overdoes itself. \n\nI thought this was interesting, maybe someone else will too.",

Either A) pay 2.8 million and extend the deadline by 3 months or B) liquidate and the stock would fall to $10.20 on Friday. When Reuters reported the vote was going to fail the stock tanked but the SPAC decided to pay the 2.8 million and extend the deadline. That was announced at 3:50 PM on Tuesday. I posted about it and said to switch to calls then. I still can't tell if you're trying to troll or just an idiot.

And not voting is equivalent to voting against the extension: \u201cThe affirmative vote of at least 65% of the Company\u2019s outstanding shares of common stock \u2026 will be required to approve the Extension Amendment Proposal.\u201d About 17.9% of those shares are owned by DWAC\u2019s sponsor and friends, who will presumably vote yes, but you still need another 47.1% (or roughly 57% of the public shareholders) to get to 65%. If DWAC can\u2019t get a majority of its shareholders to vote, it will have to cash them out, which they don\u2019t want. 5  So, rationally, they should all vote, and vote yes. But there is no guarantee in life that every single shareholder of the SPAC that is going to buy Donald Trump\u2019s social media company is entirely rational. DWAC is more or less a meme stock, with a largely retail investor base. And meme-stock retail investors, as we have discussed recently, sometimes don\u2019t vote. For instance the SPAC that took Lucid Group Inc. public had to adjourn its shareholder vote on that deal because it had a lot of retail shareholders and struggled to get them to vote, even though the stock was trading in the $20s at the time and shareholders clearly loved the deal. (Eventually they approved it.) And that was a merger vote; this is a boring extension-of-deadline vote, where it might be harder to get enthusiasm.\n\n\\- Bloomberg",

Although the vaccine was  only available initially in limited quantities, it was rapidly deployed  and this helped to contain the pandemic. President Dwight D. Eisenhower was aware of the  impending pandemic, but he initially balked at starting a nationwide  government-supported vaccination program. But once he appreciated the  severity of the problem, in August of 1957, Eisenhower asked Congress  for $500,000 in funding and authorization to shift an additional $2  million, if needed, to fight the outbreak. He set a goal of 60 million  doses of vaccines, enough to vaccinate a third of the population, (which  was around 171 million at that time). By early November, about 40  million doses had been given, and the pandemic began losing steam.\"\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHow the fuck did they do it so fast back then and we're idiots 60 years later",
